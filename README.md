## SecondServe - Food Donation Platform
SecondServe is a full-stack java desktop application designed to bridge the gap between hotels with surplus food and NGOs that serve communities in need. The platform provides a streamlined workflow for hotels to list available food, and for NGOs to request and track these donations, ultimately reducing food waste and supporting charitable work.

## Key Features
The application provides distinct portals and functionalities for three key user roles:

####  For Hotel Managers:

*   **Secure Registration & Login:** Manage the hotel's profile and credentials.
*   **Donation Approval Workflow:** Review and approve or reject surplus food items logged by kitchen staff.
*   **Request Management:** View and manage incoming donation requests from NGOs.
*   **Dashboard Analytics:** Track key statistics, like the total amount of food donated.

####  For NGOs:
*   **Secure Registration & Login:** Manage the organization's profile.
*   **Browse Donations:** View a real-time list of available food from all active hotels.
*   **Request System:** Make donation requests for specific food items.
*   **Status Tracking:** Track the status of all food requests (Pending, Approved, Rejected, Completed).

####  For Kitchen Staff:
*   **Simple Registration:** Register an account using a unique code from their manager.
*   **Log Surplus Food:** Easily log new food items with details like quantity and expiry, submitting them for approval.
